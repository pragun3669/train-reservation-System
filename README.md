# Train Reservation System

## Overview
The **Train Reservation System** is a powerful software application designed to manage train bookings efficiently. The system incorporates user authentication, shortest path computation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and a dynamic ticket management solution, handling a database of over 500 trains.

## Features
- **User Registration and Login:** Secure platform for users to register and log in.
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path between stations.
- **Ticket Management:** Book, add, cancel, and print train reservations.
- **Database Handling:** Manages train data and user reservations using Linked Lists, Graphs, Queues, and File Handling.

## Algorithms and Data Structures Used
- **Graphs:** Representation of the train network.
- **Linked Lists:** Dynamic storage of train data and reservations.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Calculation of the shortest path between stations.
- **Queues:** Management of ticket booking requests.
- **File Handling:** Persistent storage and retrieval of train and user data.

## Usage

1. **User Registration/Login:** Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2. **Book a Ticket:** Choose your source and destination; the system calculates the shortest route.
3. **Manage Reservations:** Add, book, or cancel reservations and print tickets.
